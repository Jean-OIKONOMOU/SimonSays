# What is this ?
This is a little memory game I've made. It has a Pokemon theme to it. 
There are 8 pokemon in total, flip the cards to match all the pokemon together !

# Great ! Where can I play it ?

# How did you make this ?
Plain ole' vanilla Javascript. I wanted a little refresh of the basics, so I did this.
